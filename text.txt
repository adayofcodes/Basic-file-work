This is my practice text to do examples on. I will first demonstrate how to print out of all the lines as is with the read mothod. Then I will show how to grab an individual line on this sentence. I will also print out all of sentences in a list. Following this, I will show how useful the split funtion can be. Lastly for this file, I will add another sentence using the append method. To wrap things up, I'll use the write method to create a new file and add info there.This is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentenceThis is the last sentence
